# Template Engine - Employee Summary ⚙️

 In this homework assignment, I built a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, I will also be ensuring that all unit tests pass.

### User Story 🧍
```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

### Get Started 🚀

```
npm install
```
Once complete, run the program in the terminal:
```
npm start
```
